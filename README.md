# PhotoGrabber
A side project recreating Eventstagr.am

# Uses
The app searches the latest instagram photos by default using instafeed.js. The search could also be sorted through the latest photo, least-commented, most-commented, most-liked or in a random order. The photos can be viewed as low-resolution (8 photos at a time), thumbnails (32 photos at a time) or standard-resolution (1 photo at a time. and displays the description of the photo)

The app uses Ruby on Rails as the back-end (which I plan to develop by adding photos to the database of the user), React.js as the front-end.
